# üîß TROUBLESHOOTING: Page Not Found

## ‚ùì Which method are you using?

### If using GitHub Pages:

#### Check #1: Is the file named correctly?
- File MUST be named `index.html` (not `lazarus.html`)
- Check your repository files - should show `index.html`

#### Check #2: Is GitHub Pages enabled?
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Settings"
3. Click "Pages" in left sidebar
4. Under "Source": Should say "main" branch
5. Should show: "Your site is live at https://..."

#### Check #3: Wait 2-3 minutes
- GitHub Pages takes time to build
- Refresh the page after waiting
- Clear your browser cache (Cmd+Shift+R)

#### Check #4: Is the URL correct?
The URL format should be:
```
https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY-NAME
```

**Example:**
- Username: `john123`
- Repo: `lazarus-blog`
- URL: `https://john123.github.io/lazarus-blog`

---

### If using Netlify:

#### Check #1: Did deployment finish?
- Check the Netlify dashboard
- Should show "Published" status
- Look for the URL at the top

#### Check #2: Is the URL correct?
- Copy the exact URL from Netlify
- Should be like: `https://something-12345.netlify.app`

## üéØ QUICK FIX - Try This:

### Method 1: Use Netlify Drop (EASIEST)

This will work 100%:

1. **Go to:** https://app.netlify.com/drop
2. **Drag** the `index.html` file from your folder
3. **Wait 10 seconds**
4. **Copy the URL** they give you
5. **Visit that URL** - IT WILL WORK!

No account needed, instant deployment!

### Method 2: Re-do GitHub Pages

If you used GitHub, let's start fresh:

1. **Check your repository**
   - Does it have `index.html`? (NOT lazarus.html)
   - If not, upload `index.html`

2. **Enable Pages properly**
   - Settings ‚Üí Pages
   - Source: "Deploy from a branch"
   - Branch: "main" 
   - Folder: "/ (root)"
   - Click Save

3. **Wait 3 minutes**
   - GitHub needs time to build
   - Refresh your browser

4. **Check the URL again**
   - Format: `https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME`
   - Replace USERNAME with your GitHub username
   - Replace REPO-NAME with your repository name
